# Reverse Engineering the Vive Facial Tracker

My name is Hiatus, and I am one of the developers on the Project Babble Team. 

For the past 2 years at the time of writing this, me and a team have been working on the eponymous Project Babble, a cross-platform and hardware-agnostic VR lower-face expression tracking solution for [VRChat](/docs/software/integrations/vrc), [ChilloutVR](/docs/software/integrations/chilloutVR), and [Resonite](/docs/software/integrations/resonite).

This blog post was inspired by a member of our community [DragonLord](https://github.com/LordOfDragons). His work is responsible for this feature, and this blog post largely paraphrases his findings. Again, put where credit is due and check out his Github. You can check out his findings as well as his [repo](https://github.com/LordOfDragons/vivefacialtracker) here. 

This is the story of how the Vive Facial Tracker, another VR face tracking accessory was reverse engineered to work with the Babble App.

Buckle in.

# The Vive Facial Tracker

Some context. The Vive Facial Tracker (VFT) was a VR accessory released on March 24th, 2021. Worn underneath a VR headset, it captures camera images of a user's lower face, and using an in-house AI ([SRanipal](https://docs.vrcft.io/docs/hardware/VIVE/sranipal)) converts expressions into other programs can understand. 

The VFT currently has integrations for VRChat (via [VRCFaceTracking](https://github.com/benaclejames/VRCFaceTracking)), Resonite and ChilloutVR (natively). Here is a video of it in use:

:::note
Sidenote here, it's really hard to describe the *impact* VR face tracking has had on the entirety of Social VR, at least in my experience. It's a completely different degree of immersion, you have to see it in person.
:::

Unfortunately, the VFT has been discontinued. [You can't even see it on Vive's own store anymore](https://www.vive.com/us/accessory/). Even worse, it's being scalped on eBay in excess of $1,000. Remember, this accessory cost ~$150 when it came out!!

# Understanding the VFT's hardware

Before we can begin to extract camera images from the VFT, we need to understand its underlying hardware. 

## Camera

The VFT consists of two [OV6211 image sensors](https://www.ovt.com/products/ov6211/) and an image signal processor [OV00580-B21G-1C](https://www.ovt.com/products/ov580/) from OmniVision. The cameras record at 400px\*400px at 60Hz, their images are then shrunk to 200px\*400px then put side by side, for a combined final image 400px\*400px. 

:::note
In SRanipal, these separate images are used to compute [disparity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binocular_disparity), IE provide how close an object is to the camera. This is useful for expressions in which parts of the face are closer to the camera, such as `Jaw_Forward`, `Tongue_LongStep1` and `Tongue_LongStep2`.
:::

An IR light source is used to illuminate the face of the user. The cameras do not record color information per se but rather the luminance of the IR light. This has a direct influence on the image format.


Moreover, this is the output of Video4Linux's `v4l2-ctl --list-devices`:

```
...
HTC Multimedia Camera: HTC Mult (usb-0000:0f:00.0-4.1.2.1):
        /dev/video2
        /dev/video3
        /dev/media1
...
```

As well as `v4l2-ctl -d /dev/video2 --list-formats-ext`:
```
...
ioctl: VIDIOC_ENUM_FMT
        Type: Video Capture

        [0]: 'YUYV' (YUYV 4:2:2)
                Size: Discrete 400x400
                        Interval: Discrete 0.017s (60.000 fps)
...
```

From above, we can see the VFT provides YUV422 images. 

Funnily enough though, the VFT *does not actually output a proper YUV image*. Instead, the VFT stores the grayscale image in all 3 image channels. This breaks trying to convert YUV into RGB, the resulting image can be seen below:

To workaround this, we can extract the "Y" channel use it as a grayscale image. This is pretty fast, as we only need to decode the "4" part of the YUV422 image and ignore the "22" part. 

## Lights

The VFT does not provide any controls for brightness or exposure. Instead, an exposure and gain parameter can be set directly using device registers. 

Once again, we can probe the VFT using `lsusb`:

Interestingly, the "VideoControl Interface Descriptor" guidExtensionCode's value `{2ccb0bda-6331-4fdb-850e-79054dbd5671}` matches the log output of a "ZED2i" camera online. This means the (open-source!) code of stereolabs's ZED cameras and the VIVE Facial Tracker share a lot in common, at least USB-wise:

- https://github.com/stereolabs/zed-open-capture/blob/5cf66ff777175776451b9b59ecc6231d730fa202/src/videocapture.cpp

### SB Protocol / Extension Unit

The VIVE Facial Tracker is a video type USB device and behaves like one, with an exception. The data stream is not activated using the regular means but has to be activated using the "Extension Unit". Basically the VIVE Facial Tracker is controlled by sending commands to this "Extension Unit".

In general you have to use SET_CUR commands to set camera parameters and to enable the camera stream. The device uses a fixed size scratch buffer of 384 bytes for all sending and receiving. Only the relevant command bytes are actually consumed while the rest is disregarded.

Camera parameters are set using the `0xab` request id. Analyzing the protocol there are 11 registers touched by the original SRanipal software. The ZED2i lists in particular 6 parameters to control exposure and gain:
- ADDR_EXP_H
- ADDR_EXP_M
- ADDR_EXP_L
- ADDR_GAIN_H
- ADDR_GAIN_M
- ADDR_GAIN_L

Using some testing they most probably map like this to the VIVE Facial Tracker:

| Register | Value | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `x00` | `x40` | |
| `x08` | `x01` | |
| `x70` | `x00` | |
| `x02` | `xff` | exposure high |
| `x03` | `xff` | exposure med |
| `x04` | `xff` | exposure low |
| `x0e` | `xff` | |
| `x05` | `xb2` | gain high |
| `x06` | `xb2` | gain med |
| `x07` | `xb2` | gain low |
| `x0f` | `x03` | |

The values on the left side are the registers and the value on the right side is the value set by SRanipal. Testing different values produced worse results so the values used by SRanipal seem to be the best choice. What the other parameters dso is unknown.

The `x14` request is the one enabling and disabling the data stream. Hence first the camera parameters have to be set then the stream has to be enabled.

Once the data stream is enabled the camera streams data in the YUV422 format using regular USB video device streaming.

### Windows

One small caveat, Windows has no simple access to USB devices as Linux has. Thankfully, instead of using `v4l2`, we can use [`pygrabber`](https://github.com/andreaschiavinato/python_grabber) when needs be.

## Action

Now that we have a camera image from the VFT, we just need to pass it to the Babble App. That's all it takes! Here's a video of the VFT in use with the Babble App, if you'd like to mess around with it yourself, feel free to check out the branch for it here. 

# Conclusions, Reflections

I want to give a shoutout to DragonLord for providing the code the VFT as well as making it available for the Babble App. I would also like to thank my teammates Summer and Rames, as well as Aero for QA'ing this here too.

If you're interested in a Babble Tracker we're looking to restock sometime later this March, maybe April if things go slowly. We'll make an announcement when we re-open sales, you can follow us on Twitter or join or Discord to stay up to date on all things Babble!

Until next time,

# Recommended parts list:

Sourcing ETVR V3 LED Parts:
2x Unfocused SMD IR emitters
NOTE
 The smaller ones can not be soldered at temps above 245C or they will burn. Low temp solder is recommended.
(Recommended) from LCSC here.
(Alternative) from Digikey here.
 The difference between them is the ones from LCSC are rated for lower power, which means in the event of a short or mishap they should be safer, as well as being smaller in footprint, hence why they are recommended.
2x IR emitter PCBs (highly recommended) Gerber files and schematics located here.
2x 80 ohm 1206 SMD resistors for IR emitters (If you are not using PCBs for the emitters then buying regular through-hole resistors is acceptable.)
NOTE: The resistance is significantly less than what would be used for eyetracking so we can run the LEDs at a higher power.
357 ohm Digikey here
348 ohm LCSC here
Visible Alternative: 
1x WS2812B RGB aRGB LED (Visible Light)

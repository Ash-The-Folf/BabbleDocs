## Troubleshooting

### Step 1)
To pull logs from your device, first download [EyeTrackVR's firmware flashing tool](https://github.com/EyeTrackVR/FirmwareFlashingTool/releases) from their Github. 

Before moving onto the next steps, make sure your device is plugged in and/or connected (non-boot mode this time).

### Step 2)
Open EyeTrackVR's firmware flashing tool. Select any firmware here, it doesn't matter. Just go to the next page.

If prompted for wifi, just enter anything to move on. You don't need to deal with this either.

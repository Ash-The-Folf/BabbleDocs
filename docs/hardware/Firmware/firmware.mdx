# Firmware

:::info
If you purchased a Babble PCB (by itself, as part of the Base Kit, or the Supporter Kit) you do *NOT* need to follow the directions below *if you are using it in wired mode.*

The following instructions are for users who have *assembled their own hardware* or people who wish to use the *wireless mode* with their *Babble Kit*.
:::

## Setup

Now that you've assembled your Babble Tracker, you'll need to flash the firmware for it. This guide uses the wired/wireless `wroom` setup, although the setup process is similar for other boards.

### Step 1
First, download [EyeTrackVR's firmware flashing tool](https://github.com/EyeTrackVR/FirmwareFlashingTool/releases) from their Github. 

Before moving onto the next steps, you'll need to put your device in *Boot Mode* to write firmware to it. To do this, hold down the boot mode button on your board as you plug it in. You'll feel a *click* as the button presses in and out. On the `wroom` board, the button is pictured here:

After you've plugged in the device, you can release this button.

### Step 2

Open EyeTrackVR's firmware flashing tool. You'll need to select the firmware that corresponds to your device:

If flashing wireless firmware to your device, you'll be prompted to enter your wifi network's name and password:

### Step 3

Select your device on the corresponding COM port. Then, click on the "Install Openiris" button to flash your firmware!

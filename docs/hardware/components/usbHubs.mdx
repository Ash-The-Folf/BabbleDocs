## USB Hubs

- 1x USB 3.0+ Hub
  - The hub needs to support MTT if you wish to use other high bandwidth devices with the ESPs. STT hubs can work if they are only used with other ESPs (Babble + ETVR).
  - Ensure it is of good quality, lightweight, compact in size, and has a minimum of three ports - one for the face tracker and two for ESP32-S3 boards.

- Ensure that you acquire appropriate USB-A to USB-C adapters wherever required. For example, the Valve Index only has one USB-A port.

- 1x USB-C cables (as short as possible) to connect both ESPs.
  - As the ESP32-S3 has USB-C connectors, you may require some USB-C to USB-A cables depending on your USB hub.

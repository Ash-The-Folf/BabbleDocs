### Recommended:
- 1x XIAO ESP32-S3 Sense Modules

### Alternatively:
- 1x Freenove ESP 32-S3 WROOM
  - Larger size, price may be higher than the XIAOs.
  - Supports wired and wireless connections.
  - Does not need a separate programmer.
  - Does not support a separate antenna.

### A Cheaper, Wireless-Only Alternative:
- 1x ESPCAM32 Modules
  - Cheaper option.

  **Note:** This board requires a special programmer board to flash the firmware. You'll need only one:

  - [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/) for 3 ESP32-Cams and programmers without the proper cameras.

### External Antennas for ESPs:

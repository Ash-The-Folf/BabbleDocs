Recommended
1x XIAO ESP32-S3 Sense Modules
 Very small size, wireless and wired support, does not require an additional programmer or separate antennas: SeedStudio
Alternatively:
1x Freenove ESP 32-S3 WROOM
 Much larger, price may be higher than the XIAOs, supports wired and wireless as well, does not need a separate programmer, does not support a separate antenna. Amazon
A cheaper, wireless only alternative:
1x ESPCAM32 Modules - They are cheaper, requires a separate programmer board, supports only wireless streaming and may require some soldering for attaching separate antennas: AliExpress
 This board also requires a special programmer board in order to flash the firmware. You'll need only one: AliExpress for just programmers or Amazon for 3 ESP32-Cams and programmers without the proper cameras
1x External antennas for ESPs Required if you're running vive/tundra full body tracking or having issues with streaming. See the full build guide on how to configure the ESP board for antenna use.

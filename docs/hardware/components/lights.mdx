#Lighting

For Babble you can use Infrared or visible light. Infrared is less distracting as you can’t see the light but it is susceptible to flicker from base stations if it’s not bright enough. Visible is immune to base station flicker but can potentially be distracting if your headset doesn’t block light too well.

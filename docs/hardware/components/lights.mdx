## Lighting

For Project Babble, you can use either Infrared or visible light. Each has its advantages and considerations:

- **Infrared Lighting:**
  - Less distracting as the light is not visible to the naked eye.
  - Susceptible to flicker from base stations if not sufficiently bright.

- **Visible Lighting:**
  - Immune to base station flicker.
  - Potential for distraction if the headset doesn't block light effectively.

Consider these factors when choosing the type of lighting for your setup.

For Project Babble, you can use either Infrared or visible light. Each has its advantages and considerations:

- **Infrared Lighting:**
  - Less distracting as the light is not visible to the naked eye.
  - Susceptible to flicker from base stations if not sufficiently bright.

- **Visible Lighting:**
  - Immune to base station flicker.
  - Potential for distraction if the headset doesn't block light effectively.

Consider these factors when choosing the type of lighting for your setup

## Sourcing

- **IR Emitters:**
  - 2x Unfocused SMD IR emitters
    - **Note:** The smaller ones can not be soldered at temps above 245Â°C or they will burn. Low-temp solder is recommended.
    - *(Recommended)* [LCSC](https://www.lcsc.com/product-detail/Infrared-IR-LEDs_XINGLIGHT-XL-3216HIRC-850_C965891.html)
    
- **Resistors for IR Emitters:**
  - 4x 68 ohm resistors (one for each LED/Emitter)
    - *(If not using PCBs for the emitters, regular through-hole resistors are acceptable. So if your doing DIY use through hole)*

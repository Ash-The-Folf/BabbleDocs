# Babble Tracker Quickstart

This guide applies to the Official Babble Tracker, and should cover DIY versions that use similar hardware/firmware. It will walk you through the complete setup process, from initial connection to calibration and troubleshooting.

## Getting Started
### Hardware Setup

**Plug your tracker into your PC**
1) Connect using the USB port on your tracker
1) Make sure the switch is in the "ON" position, as seen below
1) Two bright green lights should appear on the back of the tracker
1) You should hear a connection sound when properly connected

### Software Setup
#### Windows
    - Get the latest version from our [Github](https://github.com/Project-Babble/Baballonia/releases/latest). Download the installer and run it.
#### macOS/Linux
    - Currently, we do not offer installers for these platforms. You will need to build these from source.
    - For assistance building Babble Avalonia on these platforms, please contact us in our discord server.
    - Our [Legacy App](docs\software\babbleApps\babble-app.mdx) can be run from our [installer scripts](https://github.com/project-Babble/projectBabble/?tab=readme-ov-file#macos-and-linux) on the Github

### Connect to your tracker
- Open the Project Babble software
- Type the name of your tracker into the "Face Camera Address" field
- For an official Babble tracker, this will be "openiristracker"
- Older trackers and DIY solutions running serial firmware will be named COM, followed by a number
- Click "Start Camera" to connect

## Setting Up The Camera Feed

Before use, you need to properly set up your camera feed:

1. **Ensure proper positioning**
- Your face should be evenly and well-illuminated
- The tracker should be able to see your entire lower face and jaw
- Positioned at a slight angle that shows the tip of your nose/nostrils

2. **Set the crop area**
- Set the Face Camera into "Cropping" mode

- The feed may appear choppy in this mode - *this is normal*
- Click and drag across the image to set the crop area
- Make sure the cropped area includes:
    - Tip of your nose/nostrils
    - Bottom of your jaw when open
    - Sides of your cheeks when puffed

- Don't worry if the image is flipped - mirroring options are available in the "Face Camera Settings" dropdown

3. **Switch to tracking mode**
- Once you've set your crop, set your face camera back into "Tracking" mode

- You should now see a smooth video feed from your camera

## Fine-Tuning and Troubleshooting

If some expressions work better on one side than the other, or you need to adjust tracking sensitivity:

### Understanding the Calibration Tab

![Calibration Panel](/img/babbleofficaltracker/12.png)

The calibration panel allows you to manually adjust tracking values:

- **Left/Right**: Indicates which side of the face the shape corresponds to

![Left Right Options](/img/babbleofficaltracker/13.png)

- **Shapes**: The specific facial movement (left and/or right) being tracked (Mouth Open, Cheek Puff, etc.)

![Shape Names](/img/babbleofficaltracker/14.png)

- **Min**: The threshold at which the model starts detecting a shape

![Min Value](/img/babbleofficaltracker/15.png)

- **Max**: The maximum value the model detects for the shape

![Maximum Value](/img/babbleofficaltracker/16.png)

### Adjusting Values

- For proper tracking, minimum values should generally start at around 0.1
- Example with CheekPuff:
  - Setting Minimum to 0.4: You need significant cheek puffing before detection
  - Setting Maximum to 0.1: Slight cheek movement registers as full puffing

### Fixing Common Issues

If your jaw appears to lean in your neutral position:
- Adjust the minimum value for JawLeft until it's no longer detected when your face is at rest

**Pro Tip:** For precise adjustments, open your VR application's debug menu for the mouth tracking asset. Watch how values change as you make expressions, then return to the calibration tab to fine-tune.

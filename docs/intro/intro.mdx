# Introduction

Babble App is a program that takes an input from a camera and outputs the values of blendshapes. These values are then piped to either VRCFT or the game directly to drive the blendshapes of an avatar. 

# VRChat Overview
1. Download and install the [Babble App](https://github.com/SummerSigh/ProjectBabble/releases)
2. Follow the setup instructions for your hardware
3. Download and install [VRCFaceTracking](https://docs.vrcft.io/) and install the Babble Module from the module registry. 
4. Enable OSC in VRChat and change into a VRCFT compatible avatar. 

# Supported Camera Inputs
* UVC (USB) Webcameras*
* MJPEG Streams
* OpenIris Serial

*Logitech Cameras are known to be problematic

# Detailed Setup guide
### 0. Check Compatibility 
If you can get a view of the mouth and pipe it into Babble, it can in theory work. 

### 1. Download and Install the Babble App 
  Download the installer in the [releases](https://github.com/SummerSigh/ProjectBabble/releases) tab on github.

### 2. Set Camera Address
  Insert the Camera IP address, COM (serial) port, or UVC (usb webcam) camera ID in the address slot and click save and restart tracking. What exactly you need to put is explained in the hardware page.  

### 3. Set Mouth Crop 
  Enter cropping mode and crop the frame to your lower face. (Try to keep the crop as square as possible)

### 4. Setup VRCFT 
Install VRCFT and install the Babble module from the VRCFT Module Registry.

### 6. Test with a Public VRCFT Avatar
At this time, VRChat does **not** have a native face tracking solution.
Avatars must have been specifically set up for face tracking to work with VRCFaceTracking.

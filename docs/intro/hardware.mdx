## Setup
To get started, attach your camera to your VR headset. Ideally, it should be in front of and slightly lower than your jaw, angled upwards. Also ensure your face is evenly lit, if possible.

It doesn't matter if your camera is upside down! You can configure this in the Project Babble App settings.

If you have used the HTC Vive Facial tracker, then the position should be somewhat the same.

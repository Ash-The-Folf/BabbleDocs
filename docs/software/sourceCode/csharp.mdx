# Running the Baballonia source code

This page covers how to download and run the source code for the Babble App.

## 1) Prerequisites

To get started, you will need to install:

- [`git`](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [`git-lfs`](https://git-lfs.com/)
- A copy of Visual Studio 2022 or Rider 2024+

## 1) Downloading The Babble App

Navigate to a folder where you would like to install the Babble App.

Then, open a terminal in your folder. Make sure its current directory matches the folder!

Now, run this command to download the Babble App to the folder:

```
git clone https://github.com/Project-Babble/Baballonia.git
```

You will need to clone this repo's submodules.

## 2) Downloading the right SDKs

Both Visual Studio 2022 and Rider 2024+ will detect and prompt you to download the proper SDKs for build the Babble App.

# Eballs

:::info
Eballs is only able to be used with headsets that have eye tracking hardware either natively or with an addon like ETVR
:::

## Setting Up Eye Cameras
### Camera Selection
    Select your left and right eye cameras from the dropdown in Baballonia

![eyeselection](/img/eballs/eyeselect.png)

### Cropping
    In the majority of cases you should leave your eye cameras uncropped
        1) Go to cropping mode and click "Select Left/Right Frame"
        2) Return to tracking mode

### Special Cases
    #### Bigscreen Beyond 2E
        The 2E's eye camera stream, called Bigeye, is a single feed containing both left and right eye

        If Baballonia doesn't automatically seperate them use the following steps
             1) In the Left Eye Camera, enter cropping mode and click "Select Left Frame"
             2) In the Right Eye Camera, enter cropping mode and click "Select Right Frame"
    #### Single eye setups
        If using a single camera for eye tracking you only need to input the feed into one eye, Baballonia will handle the rest!
## Eye Tracking Calibration
### Getting started
    #### Setting up your calibration enviroment
        You **Must** be facing the forward direction of your playspace in SteamVR
            - in the steamvr home menu press the "Recenter" button
            
        ![steamvr](/img/eballs/steamvr.png)
        
        It is *highly* reccomended to do the calibration steps in a dark enviroment clear of anything that might distract you or catch your eye such as the default SteamVR enviroment
    #### Starting Calibration
    :::info
    Starting calibration in baballonia will launch the overlay in your VR view and begin calibration, make sure you're ready to begin beforehand
    :::
    To begin calibrating click the "Eye Calibration" button in baballonia

### Gaze Calibration
:::info
For many headsets the quality and reliablility of eye tracking can be improved by slightly shifting the headset around during calibration
:::
    During gaze calibration you should remain focused on the dot at all times
    There are a few reccomended movements to do while looking at the dot for optimal calibration
        #### 1) The Ring
            Move your head so the dot is rotated around the entire edge of your field of view
        #### 2) The Grid
            Move your head in a side to side motion like tracing all the lines on graph paper while keeping the dot within the bounds of the view
        #### 3) The Cross
            Move your head so the dot moves to the edges of the view in the vertical and horizontal directions
### Blink Calibration
    During blink calibration you must keep your eyes closed until it finishes, though feel free to make expressions as this helps with robust blink detection
    
    Alternating between relaxed and tightly closed eyes also helps with correct detection
